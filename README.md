# mergesort
basic C styled implementation of mergesort for integers and floating-points

this is something every programmer needs in his/her programming cookbook.
the sort runs on O(N log(N)) complexity for both best-case and worst-case scenarios.
in terms of complexity, mergesort is superior to quicksort. unfortunately it 
uses a lot of memory allocation compared to quicksort, and may not always be
superior during benchmarking. merge-sort is great for linked list sorting, though
